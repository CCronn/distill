When I needed help there were countless blogs, threads and videos to assist me. I have benefited greatly from the help and knowledge of the online R community. I would now like to give back.\r\nI will gradually add to this website with regard to methodology that I have used in my analyses among other topics. Hopefully this will be a helpful resource for someone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
