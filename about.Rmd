```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

I began learning to use R in January 2021. During that time, many hours were spent googling and figuring out little issues along the way. When I needed help there were countless blogs, threads and videos to assist me. I have benefited greatly from the help and knowledge of the online R community. I would now like to give back. 

I will gradually add to this website with regard to methodology that I have used in my analyses among other topics. Hopefully this will be a helpful resource for someone.
